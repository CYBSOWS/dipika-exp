                  FORMAL Apology to Dr. Staszkiewicz
                                by: Bone
 
        This is a formal apology to Mark J. Staszkiewicz.
 
        Dr. Staszkiewicz is the Provost of Indiana University of PA.
 
        I was misinformed when I stated in CRN! Newsletter .05 that Dr.
Staszkiewicz was the deciding factor in the removal of AOHELL03.ZIP.
 
        In fact Dr. Staszkiewicz had no idea what was going on.  I was
told in fact that Dr. Staszkiewicz is actually a very nice guy, and
didn't even care what was on the homepage.
 
        He was mainly upset about his information being posted.  I only
posted the information because it was readily available via the web anyway.
 
        I made a mistake and I will admit to it. I apologize to for any
inconvience this may have caused to Dr. Staszkiewicz.
 
        I ask anyone who had intended on E-mailing Dr. Staszkiewicz to please
do not do so. I have already sent Dr. Staszkiewicz an apology via E-mail.
 
        I am human and I do make mistakes. I will have to further investigate
situations such as this if they ever do arise again.
 
        Again, I am sorry about this mistake. And hope that no harm will come
to anyone.
 
                                                Yours,
                                                  Sloan Seaman (a.k.a. Bone)

			 INTRODUCTION
  		           by: Bone

	Here we are on our first official issue of CRN! newsletter.  It's 
only been a few weeks since an incident with America OnLine (AOL) 
prompted me to start CRN! and we are already on our first newsletter.

	We here at CRN! (mainly myself, Bone) are here to fight 
against groups, organizations, and corporations which are infringing on 
our "cyber rights".

	Though I am (basically) the only person writing the newsletter, 
I receive over 10 pieces of mail a day from different people agreeing 
with my point of view on "cyber rights" and willing to help out.  Of 
course there have been people against CRN! but that is expected, and 
even welcomed.

	I formed CRN! to not just go after AOL and not be a personal 
vendetta.  Nor was CRN! formed to totally remove corporations from the 
net.  As stated earlier, it was formed to help people who are being "push 
around" on the net.

	The exact purpose of the newsletter is to inform people of what 
is happening in "cyberspace".  We are going to have articles on cyber 
rights, comments about what CRN! is doing (both good and bad), lists of 
people to contact to either complain about the infringement of cyber 
rights, or to congratulate.

If you have any questions regarding CRN!, e-mail me at:
	seaman@phobos.lib.iup.edu
or check out the CRN! homepage at:
	http://www.lib.iup.edu/~seaman/index.html
it is also possible to join CRN! on the homepage or via e-mail with the 
attached form (located at the end of this file).

	Well, hopefully CRN! will be around a while.  I'd like it to be a 
force to reckon with and a voice of reality to the real world.

	Fighting for your rights somewhere out there,
		Bone 

**********************************************************
	             THE CRN! MANIFESTO
		         by: Bone

	This is the rough draft of the CRN! manifesto.  This is mainly 
the view or one person, but others have offered opinions.

CRN! is a group formed to fight for the rights of the common user.

CRN! believes that the current state of the net is getting worse.  As more 
corporations and government agencies struggle to control the net, CRN! 
believes that the net should be as it has been.  Free.

CRN! believes that all non-copyrighted software has the right to exist on 
the net.  This information should be free to store, transmit, and 
distribute.  No one should be told what they can or cannot store, 
transmit, or distribute over the net unless it matches one of the following 
criteria:
	The information is copyrighted
	The information is pornographic and is being distributed
		to minors.
CRN! does not defend the above because of existing laws outside of the 
net.  We do believe that programs such as AOHELL, Virii, and other 
program in that area do have the right to exist on the net.  Programs are 
just like guns.  If you give someone a gun, it's not your fault if they use 
it.  That was their choice.

CRN! believes that everyone has a right to be on the net.

CRN! only condones those corporations/agencies that try in any way to 
regulate what occurs on the net (outside of copyright infringement).

CRN! does not believe in crashing, damaging, or breaking into systems 
that belong to companies that are against cyber rights.  These acts are 
frowned upon by CRN!.

	       WHY MY HOMEPAGE WENT BYE BYE
			   by: Bone

	Some of you may be wondering why my homepage “Bone’s 
H/P/C page o ‘rama” went the way of the dinosaurs.  It’s kind of a long 
story but here goes.
	Around August 23rd America OnLine contacted the assistant 
provost of Indiana University of PA.  AOL informed the assistant provost 
that the file AOHELL.ZIP resided on my homepage.  They told the 
assistant provost that the file created false AOL accounts, allowed e-mail 
bombs to be created, and did a lot of other nasty things.  It did a few of 
them, but all of them I do not know.  The assistant provost called the 
campus library (where the machine resides) and informed the head of 
Information Systems to remove the file.  The Sys Admin instead disabled 
the entire homepage (AUTHOR NOTE: the Sys Admin is a cool guy, trust 
me).  When I was informed of the situation I removed the file as 
requested.
	The homepage was them moved back into it’s rightful position.  I 
then created Cyber Rights Now! (CRN!) in the hopes of making sure 
peoples rights were upheld on the Internet.  It was also created so 
corporations like AOL could not do what they had just done.  The file 
AOHELL was not copyrighted, and therefor was legal on the Internet.
	Later that week I wrote the first CRN! Newsletter Issue .05.  In 
this newsletter I stated that the Provost (not the assistant provost) had 
made the decision like a dictator to remove the file.  At the time I was told 
it was the provost who had made the decision.  I learned on 9/7 that it was 
in fact the assistant provost.
	Also in the newsletter I asked readers to send the provost E-mail 
informing him that they were against the removal of the file.  It seems 
quite a lot of people told him how they felt.  This is good but he didn’t do 
anything.  A major screw up on my part.
	I have offered a formal apology to him.  I do not know if he has 
accepted it. What I do know is that upon receiving all the E-mail he 
decided to see what the homepage was all about.  
	Mainly he was upset about the E-mail (which is understandable) 
and he has decided to possibly (and I hope to god he doesn’t) put me up 
for academic peer review.  Basically academic peer review is a board who 
meets and decides how to discipline you.  They can even expel you.  He 
did state he really didn’t care what was on the page, it was the e-mail 
address.
	My defense was that the campus phone book (with e-mail 
addresses) is available through the web.  That is how I got the 
information.
	From what I have heard the provost is actually a really nice guy.  
I am hoping this is true and this situation can be worked out.
	Back to where the homepage went.
	The Sys Admin decided on the same day I received the E-mail 
from the provost (when it rains, it pours) to check who has been accessing 
my homepage.  He found that some of the people who had been hitting my 
homepage were : CIA, FBI, possible MAFIA, and the NSA.  This scared 
them just a bit (understandably).
	They immediately locked my account.  I talked with them about 
it (they are very nice people actually) and they unlocked my account.  
They said I should try to move my homepage since it was on the library’s 
machine and not on the main campus machine.  I could use the library’s 
machine for storage (they have over 9 gigs and only 8 users).  I tar’d up 
my homepage and that is where it is now.
	I was later informed through the grapevine (I know a lot of 
people at IUP) that the Sys Admin of the main campus machine had 
possibly fueled/egged the provost on to trying to get me reviewed.
	The main campus machine Sys Admin and I have not always 
seen eye to eye.  I used to E-mail quite often trying to improve the system 
(Currently a VAX/VMS that is configured in a way unknown even to god) 
by letting me install programs like more, less, fsp, and so on.
	I am currently sitting back hoping I don’t hear from the 
gentleman involved in peer reviews.  The provost has not replied to my 
latest E-mail as of yet.
	I’ve talked to some people and it is possible that my homepage 
may be stored (minus the files) on www.iup.edu, and the files (accessed 
via links) on www.lib.iup.edu.  This may be a way to keep the homepage 
alive.
	So has any good come of this?  Actually, yes.  IUP is now in the 
process of defining rules for homepage use and the like.  This was needed.  
The school has a very vague policy towards computer on campus.  
	Any bad come of this?  Well let’s see:
		My homepage is down (the hack part)
		I may get thrown out of school
		I always suspected the FBI had a file on me.......
		I'’m not mister popular anymore.....
	That’s the story so far.  'I’ll keep you updated.

AUTHOR NOTE:  I ask of you to NOT send anyone E-mail regarding my 
situation until things have cooled down a bit.  My rights were not 
infringed upon since I was on the library’s machine.  If this had occurred 
on the VAX (where I pay for an account) things may have been different.

                          THE CORRUPTION IN AOL
			      by: John Doe

	As you all know, AOL is one of the most popular services available
to the public. It has an easy to use interface and somewhat friendly staff
to make people feel comfortable. Well all this is just a stupid disguise for
the screwed up people behind the service. They are trying to govern the way
the people on the Internet do things as well as the people that are on their
service.
	One example of this is Bone's H/P/C page was shut down because he
had AOHELL in his file area and AOL did not see this as appropriate. What
makes this so crazy is that the program itself is not illegal and is free to
be posted anywhere on the Internet that has the space for it. But the fact
of the matter is not the program but AOL because they had forced the
Sysadmin to shut down the page for a while.
	Another example that just makes this online service more corrupt is
the way they do not shut down areas that are even worse then hacking related
areas. Just logon to AOL and get to the list of member rooms and you'll
see about 90% of them are pornographically or adult related. There are even
rooms like Boy4man2use and other sick things. But AOL never pays attention
to these although they find even one member room that is hacking related and
they shut it down and record the names of the people in the room. They also
record the names of people that enter private rooms like WAREZ or PHATE but
don't shut down the rooms. But I think that AOL should either enforce all
the rooms or just leave them alone.
	Recently there have been accusations against AOL because of a flaw
in their software. Every time someone logged on there were a couple minutes
added to the persons bill which over time, gave Steve Case a few million
more dollars in his pocket. Now them not detecting this flaw in 2.5 million
users in very unlikely. I believe that some employee of the company or
someone implemented the flaw themself. But I do hope that they get sued or
something to make them understand the fault.
	Today as I took a few minutes off of writing this to just check for
any new info, Steve Case had put out his new monthly letter to the users. I
will show a cliiping of it for you:

[begining clipping]


A LETTER FROM STEVE CASE, PRESIDENT & CEO OF AMERICA ONLINE

September 7, 1995

Dear Members:

I hope you've all had a great summer!  Now it's back to school and (for
those of you returning from a vacation) back to work time.

We'll certainly be working harder than ever, to keep up with our continued
rapid growth (this past weekend we passed the 3.5 million member mark!), to
keep improving AOL to better meet your needs.

The good news is that with 3.5 million members (and growing), we can
continue to add more features and interesting content.  The flip side is
that with a population that big, there will most likely be disruptive
people, as there are in any major city of that size.  That brings me to the
issues of safety and security.

Security on the Internet and on online services is a topic that is
frequently in the news, and Hollywood has even portrayed hackers in an
upcoming movie.  If you've read some of my previous letters, I've discussed
our efforts to ensure that AOL is a safe online community -- not just for
kids, but for members of all ages.  Occasionally, there are people who break
the rules, just as some do in the communities where we live.  When this
happens, we all need to take measures to protect our community and reduce
the number of incidents that can occur.

Specifically, there have been some cases where certain individuals are
passing themselves off as employees or representatives of America Online,
and then asking members at random for their passwords.  Please know that
this is not our policy -- under no circumstance will anyone from AOL ever
ask you for your password (even if they say they're from the billing
department and want your account information).  Your password is a secret
code that only you should have.

Recently we've begun a program to remind members to periodically change
their passwords.  If you see the notice, it will come in the form of a
"system" reminder -- again, no individual will contact you personally.
In case you don't see the notice, take a moment during this session and
change your password.  We suggest you change it on a regular basis, too.
(I change mine about four times a year.).  Make sure yours has at least six
alphanumeric characters (letters and/or numbers), and don't make it the same
as or similar to your screen name!  It's easy to change your password --
either go to the tool bar at the top of this screen and click on Personal
Choices, or just use keyword PASSWORD.  It'll take you all about 15 seconds
to do.  And parents, please conduct the same procedure with your children's
passwords.  (Use Keyword PARENTAL CONTROLS for other security measures you
can take.)

The other issue involves another small, but disturbing segment of the
population -- hackers.  These are individuals who search for opportunities
to 'hack,' or disturb, computer system functions.  Unfortunately, it happens
everywhere, and authorities from around the world are spending a good deal
of time and money to thwart these criminals.  For a long time, we have had a
team in place to deal with hacker incidents.  So when we discover hackers on
occasion, we aggressively take measures to head them off.  As part of our
ongoing security program, we have procedures in place to monitor systems and
hacker activity, and to change systems as appropriate.  In fact, our team
recently installed new system software to fix some recent problems that were
discovered.

While we're trying to eradicate the hacking incidents, I'd like to ask you,
as an AOL "cybercitizen," to report any unusual or improper behavior that
you see immediately.  If you're in a chat room, notify our Terms of Service
advisory unit by using keyword GUIDEPAGER.   Email, Instant Message, and
Message Board violations should be reported to keyword TOS.  (For those of
you who are new to keywords, just click on the tool bar icon above that
displays an arrow, or while holding down the control or command key on your
keyboard, hit the letter "K" on your keyboard.  Then type the keyword.)

In summary, we all need to join together to ensure a secure and enjoyable
online environment and community.

We've added a lot of new services in the past month, so the rest of this
month's letter will be focused on bringing you up to speed on the additions
and to highlight special events.


[end of clipping]

	First thing, they are starting to grow a lot faster so be warned
that we may see more trouble from the service in the future. Second, they
are first defining a "hacker" falsely. The real deffinition of a hacker is
someone who is experienced in many areas of the computer field and wishes to
know more by using his skills to learn things, but they say that all they
define a hacker as is a person who causes havoc in their online service.
They also compare them to the upcoming movie "Hackers" which is due out on
September 15. Although I have not seen the movie myself, I have seen
previews and read things about it to understand that it is nowhere near to
what the real life of a hacker is. All AOL does is just disillusion their
customers so they will trust and stay with the service and use the mask of
the media which already gives people like us a bad name.
	Also mentioned in this letter is the fact they are bringing in
security specialists to try and crack down on hackers, although the only
thing they mention on the pronogrophy is to try to put parental controls on,
they won't enforce it themself. But as I was saying, they are going to be
just giving us a harder time in the anarchy of the Internet which makes us
speak freely and distibute information without restrictions. An example of
what they already did is brining down Bone's web page and that was just the
beginning.
	Part of the security measures they have taken is monitoring rooms
(which I mentioned earlier), immediate messages, and mail. I have tested
this myself. Using AOHELL, the program which is what AOL defines as a
"security risk" I fooled some people that have been on AOL for a while into
giving me their passwords. Now considering that they talk about normal
social and personal things, AOL probably won't watch them. I found this to
be false. I connected to AOL on different accounts on my PC and laptop by my
side and relayed e-mail and immediate messages about false information on
evading an ANI system. After a few minutes of doing this, I got a message
from an AOL official saying "identify yourself". This is proof that the
online service does not allow even privacy to the users peronal affairs let
alone not allowing people to speak freely and do what they want to do. This
I think is the most corrupt part of this online service. They will go to any
extent to have total control of their network and a large amount of the
Internet themself.
	I hope that I shed some light on the truth about America Online and
the people that run it. Because of the things I have done to obtain some of
this information, I am remaining anonymous. Although if you wish to contact
me about any comments or questions, please mail me at my anonymous e-mail
address: John.Doe@sidewayz.com

	 	    AOL'S LETTERS TO PEOPLE
		       by: Bone & Anonymous

	This is a copy of the letter I recieved that was sent to my 
university:

>Dear Garrett Bozylinsky,
>
>It has been brought to our attention that a file entitled "AOHell" is
>available on your server.  This file allows users to email bomb other
>Internet users, forge email headers, generate fake credit card
>numbers, generate fraudulent America OnLine accounts, and  
>impersonate America OnLine Staff all at the click of a button.  Due to 
>the malicious nature and possible illegality of this file, we would
>appreciate any efforts you could take to remove it from your server.
>
>The file in question can be found using the following path.
>
>http://www.lib.iup.edu/~seaman/hack/files/misc/
>
>Thank you,
>
>James Canfield
>Terms of Service Staff
>America OnLine, Inc.
>703.448.8700 X3909

EDITOR'S NOTE: The file has been removed.  This was due to the fact 
that the account that my homepage is on was given to me freely.  I still 
have a copy of the file and am currently looking for a better place to 
store it.

	The letter below was send to a member of CRN!.  This is the
entire unedited letter:

	We represent The Internet Access Company,
Inc. ("TIAC").  TIAC has received a demand letter from
an attorney representing America OnLine, Inc. ("AOL").
In the letter, AOL alleges that your web site
"http://www.tiac.net/users/triad/philes/other.html"
contains a program called AOHell.  AOL alleges that
the program violates AOL copyrights and trademarks.
AOL also alleges that AOHell is used to commit fraud
on America On-line, fraud on banks and credit cards
issuers and other serious acts.

AOL has requested that TIAC terminate your AOHell
page.
 
        TIAC is not in a position to judge the validity of the
claims asserted by AOL.  However, given the seriousness
of the claims, TIAC has blocked access to your AOHell
page to allow you the opportunity to either voluntarily
remove the AOHell material or to resolve any dispute about
your distribution of AOHell with AOL.   The attorney at
AOL who contacted TIAC is John D. Gardiner, Counsel,
phone:  (703) 918-2042.
 
        TIAC reminds you that all use of your TIAC account
must be lawful.  If you have any questions about lawful use
of your account, you should consult your attorney.
 
        Please contact me if you have any questions about
this letter.
 
                                                Sincerely,

			AOL CONTACTS
		       by: Bone & B.I.

Here is a small list of some of the people you can contact at AOL.
If you don't write these people, AOL will continue to do what they wish.
DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS!

	This is AOL's terms of service advisor. Just one guy
	responsible for closing down "Hackers"

James Canfield

SteveCase@aol.com
	AOL's president.

**********************************************************
		   AN OPINION ON AOL
		       by: B.I.

	This whole AOHell story continues to amaze me...check this 
shit out.   From what I have seen, there is evidence supporting that the 
newest version of AOHell (3.0 beta 4) was either created by AOL or the 
AOL software detects it because AOHell supposedly sends a mail to 
AOL informing them that you  are using AOHell.
	AOL administrators also don't understand that AOHell is not 
made purely for making fake accounts as I have used it myself. Basically 
AOHell originally was a pretty cool program. In the early copies there 
was no CC generators or any shit like that. AOHell let AOL users do 
things like download software will talking in chat rooms (AOL 2.5 lets 
you do this now) and scroll macros in chat rooms. It did do many 
annoying things and many AOL officials gave real bullshit stories about 
AOHell and how it was a virus.
	 That is why your story REALLY struck a chord with me. I 
myself have seen AOL's crazy responses to "hacker" programs etc.. by 
AOL. A good example of AOL's stupidity would be the Hackers Member 
room. AOL closed this room down repeatedly when there were NO 
illegal activities and such even taking place there. The funny thing about 
that is that is that AOL is crawling with Porno and weird bestiality 
rooms. Its not uncommon to see rooms like "anal sex" "Gayteengifs" and 
"little boy sex" on AOL. AOL does nothing about these but closes down 
Hackers!

**********************************************************
              DISCLAIMER FOR YOUR HOMEPAGE
                    by: Bone & Triad
  
        The following was a disclaimer sent to me by a CRN! member.
He stated that it could help protect your homepage.  If any lawyers read
this and feel like doing some research, please do.
 
107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair Use
 
Not withstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use
of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
phono records or by any other means specified by that section, for
purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
(including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research,
is not an infringement of copyright.

	              COMMENTS/OPINIONS
 	 	*WARNING: THESE ARE UNEDITED.*
	            *SWEARING DOES OCCUR*

	" I want to join this group. Most of the real d00ds here in the 
803 sc3n3 are sick and tired of being mislabeled as "hackers" and shit 
because we know about computers. Granted we do sometimes what is 
called "hacking" (societal definition), we are tired of the bullshit. A 
friend in 513 just got raided a couple of days ago because the 
goddamned phedz didn't like the fact that he had hpacv shit on there as 
well as tone loc (there were on warez to bust him on). Ever since the 
OKC disaster, the Internet has come under scrutiny because the fertilizer 
bomb instructions were found on it. The gov't has been allocating 
fucking tons of money to state and local law enforcement agencies to 
develop special "computer crime" divisions. These assholes have no clue 
as to what they're doing, but they have a damn badge, so they can go 
crazy and shit. enough already..I want to help you bring this 
organization forward and free the Internet from the hands of money-
grabbing corporations. I can post to many other sites as well as good 
BBSs  if you would like. just specify which. later"

	" Hello. I have been to your web page a number of times and 
liked what you had. I thought it was crazy when they had your web page 
shut down. I know a lot about them and view them as one of the most 
corrupt Online providers there is. I got a hold of AOHELL when a 
friend let me use his account (I have real Internet access, I just wanted to 
check out a keyword that was only on AOL) and I used it to make fake 
accounts. I discovered a number of things through the use of it. When I 
read alt.2600 I just ignored stuff on AOL cause all the people on it were 
not true hackers like you and me. But I saw how screwd up it was by my 
use of it. The system allows porn traders and child molesters to roam 
around freely. 90% of the memeber rooms are adult related and have 
things like boy4man2rape and such which is sickening. What is more 
surprising is how they pay no attention to these rooms but they 
immediately shut down hacking rooms or warez rooms made available 
to the public. They monitor the private ones which people enter not 
knowing AOL is watching. I know they are because I once tested how 
they monitor things when I connected to computers to AOL on fake 
accounts and relayed false info on evading an ANI system. After a few 
minutes an AOL official came out and said "Identify yourself". This 
proved my theory that they do watch everything but will not bother to 
rid of all the pronographic material and child molesters roaming all 
over. "

	" I totally aggree with your point of view.  The net should stay
free.  commercial organizations like AOL, Compushit and others,
I believe, don't really have a rightful place on the net
period.  Now, the server you have you're account on offers
something back to the net, It may be as little as a WWW server
where others can go and look at the users home pages, but at
least it's there, if it's like mine, it probably also at least
a mirror FTP site for something.  AOl and others offer nothing
back.  They allow they're users to go in and totally f*ck up
newsgroups (at a totally ridiculous cost to the users), FTP
stuff,  WWW browse (all at bullshit costs), but offer NOTHING
back.  If you're not on AOL, you can't get any files from them,
got no pages to even browse.  And after hearing of you're
little incident, that just goes to far."

		--------------------------------------

	" Thanks. With all of the guys out there who say that they are 
active, but never do anything, somebodys got to do something. You did
something. Keep doing it and assholes like AOL will realize that THEY
DO NOT OWN THE INTERNET, and to keep there butts out of 
cybercitizens home pages. Your account, your homepage. They cant go 
to your house and wreck your car because they dont like the paint job, 
they cant wreck your homepage cause they dont like the files. If I ever 
set up an inet site, I am gonna get a degree in law first. Bye!"

" >...I see to many posers (or l.a. stylers if you are from the old school)
          ^^
>A fate determined by those with money.
(gasp!! and to imagine that somebody would want to control how their 
own money was used!! heresy!)
 >Though I really expect a lame responce to the rant & rave above...
                               ^^^^^^^^
OK, Here it is...
 1. I've got Money, it's GREAT!!
2. Get a life/job, maybe then you'll wise up,
3. Learn to spell big words like "response",
4. Learn the proper use of the word "to".
The world is odd enough without illiterate extremists boo-hooing 
because they can't have their way with other people's money/equipment. 
The way to make a difference is to get to a position where control can be 
exerted. Rants about "Cyber Rights" (found in the Cyber Constitution, 
no doubt) do little more than waste bandwidth and make you look 
foolish.
 BTW, if you're not a "poser" or "l.a. styler" yourself (which leads to the
observation: most people I've heard use the term "Old School" think the 
60's are ancient history, and would'nt know OLD if it bit them on the 
ass), you should be able to figure out where this came from. (I'll give you 
a hint: I'm not jbmyers.)
 Have a nice day. ;^)

EDITORS NOTE: This was in response to the original header I had 
placed upon entering my homepage after the AOL incident.  Granted I 
can't spell well.  But I am probably older than this gentleman, and I do 
know how to use port 25 to write fake e-mail.  But, everyone is allowed 
their opinions.  It's one of the great things about America.  On yes.  I do 
have a good job.
