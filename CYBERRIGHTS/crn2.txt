			INTRODUCTION
		          By Bone

	Welcome to CRN! Newsletter #2.  I honestly didn't even think 
we would make it to Issue #1 and here we are at #2.  Cool.
	CRN! membership continues to grow daily.  At last count (on 
10/1/95) we were at 174 registered readers.  That's not that bad 
considering CRN! really is a word of mouth/e-mail circulation thing.  
We have members from all over the world, and accessing from all 
different kinds of computers.  The one group we seem to be missing is 
.gov.  They don't seem to want to register (Even though I know they are 
still accessing the page).  Ah well, you know big bro, he want's you to 
think he isn't there (yea right).
	One thing that has seem to decrease is the e-mail I have been 
receiving concerning CRN! or cyber rights in general.  As of right now, 
this may be a short newsletter because of lack of articles.  People who 
said they would send articles are falling short.  But everyone get busy, so 
that's no prob.  I'm shocked by the lack of e-mail because of all the 
things AOL has been doing to regulate people.  I'm shocked some of the 
AOL users even put up with it.
	On the subject of articles, anyone can submit them.  They don't 
have to be really specific, or just AOL (they are just the one's doing the 
most right now).  You can write about how your school shut down your 
account for stupid reasons, or anything else like that.  As you can see I 
sometimes rant and rave on topics not totally related to cyber rights.  
That's cool. Go for it.
	For those of you who have been accessing my homepages and 
noticing some screwy things or files missing, all will be explained later 
in this newsletter.  Trust me, it will be fully operational soon, and have 
even more files (maybe even AOHELL3?!).
	I've been trying to find the author of AOHELL3 but most of my 
underworld contacts have dried up, and it's not going so well.  We do 
now have a lawyer who reads the newsletter and offered to write about 
things from a legal point of view (but he hasn't answered in a while 
either).
	If you notice I say we a lot.  I mean all the members of CRN!.  
This newsletter was created to express the masses views.  Not just mine, 
but everyone who agrees that cyber rights are being abused.  So I write 
this from the point of view of a group, not a single individual.
	If you notice that this issue is rather short it is because the 
people who had promised me articles decided not to ever send them to 
me.  So I wrote what I could with the time I had (very little time mind 
you).  Hopefully with all the new members we will have some authors 
who like to write.
	OK, enough with the intro.  Lets get to it.

	THE RETURN OF BONE'S H/P/C PAGE O 'RAMA
			By Bone

	Last issue I talked about why my homepage basically fell off the 
Earth.  Now I'm here to tell you that it's back and what I'm doing to keep 
it back.
	If you recall AOL along with the FBI, CIA, NSA, and so on 
helped in the removal of my homepage.  If none of you have ever been to 
my homepage it contains Virii, Hacking tools, Cracking tools, Credit 
Card information files, and other things along those lines.  None of the 
software is copyrighted though.
	After finding that all the above organizations had been 
accessing it, the Sys Admin asked me to remove it.  And I did.  If you 
also recall, AOL had actually contacted my school.
	After talking with the Sys Admin and finding all the holes in 
the schools rules concerning computers, I can to a conclusion.
	The machine I was storing the page on belonged to the library, 
no the school (technically).  The library could tell me what I could and 
could not do with my account because I was an employee and I did not 
pay for the account.
	The school account on the other hand I did pay for.  Every 
student at IUP gets an account as soon as they enroll and they pay for it.  
Since I was paying for the account, I had more rights.  But there was 
one small problem.  The User accounts are only allocated 800k of 
storage space.  My homepage needed over 20 megs.
	The school did have what is called an ldisk which is basically a 
public storage space 1 gig in size.  But they auto delete the files after a 
week.  So this was not a very feasible option.
	So here is what I did.  The Sys Admin of the library computer 
told me he didn't care about the files, and he had plenty of space.  He 
said he would let me use the library's machine as a storage location.
I then moved the homepages only to the school computer.  There is 
nothing illegal about having html code on the mainframe.
	All the html that points to files goes to the library's machine,  
bypassing the storage problem.  Ta da! Back up.
	Some of you may notice that the pages seem to get screwed up 
sometime.  This is because the homepages are on a VAX/VMS that is 
configured in the oddest way.  It's not my fault and but I am trying to 
correct what I can.
	Does this mean I can put AOHELL back online?  Very VERY 
possible.  I'm discussing it with the library Sys Admin.  He believes I 
have every right to have the file, as long as I don't use it (kinda like a 
gun).  The only thing holding me back is that the Sys Admin of the 
VAX/VMS has been known to go and just delete files.  This is highly 
illegal.  I've talked to my lawyer and if he did such a thing I could 
possibly file a class action suit and get over $500,000.  So in a way I'm 
hoping he does it.  What is holding me back is the Computer Science 
Department (which I am a senior in).  They have never liked me and I 
am currently asking the to make an exception to a minor they usually 
don't accept.  Once it's accepted, AOHELL3 will probably go online.
	More files will also be coming.  I haven't had time to dedicate 
to the homepage like I used to, and I am sorry.
	Anyway, so what does this have to do with cyber rights?  Well 
if you read the first newsletter you will see.  It's also an example of how 
you can get around things in the system like the corporations do.
	Oh yea, if you don't know, my homepages are:

Mike, lets rap about one of your "special forces" coordinating activities
w/Jason Mitchell (Webmaster) to handle searches of web sites on a 
regular basis, and keeping a report of this.

Ellen and Dave:

Last Tuesday (Aug 22) I arranged a meeting between AOL and Federal 
law enforcement to discuss AOHell.  In addition to me, AOL attendees 
included: Pete Hypolite, Brad Willard, David Kirk, a consultant 
assisting Kirk, a Webmaster (Jason).  Fed attendees included: FBI Agent 
Hugh McLean, FBI Agent Court Jones, DOJ Attorney Philip Reitinger.

I provided the Feds with background information for the meeting and
presented our case, with support from Pete, Brad and David.  Jason 
(from the Webmaster group) downloaded AOHell and gave a 
presentation of Credit Wizard (the credit card generator) and the 
AOHell functionality.

The presentation was basically along the lines that through AOHell, 
adept users may can hack AOLis network using a variety of fictitious 
names and actual credit card and bank account numbers.  Though AOL 
has implemented procedures to detect patterns of usage of AOHell, and 
has thus been able to terminate a substantial number of AOHell users 
and track some of them down, people are still using the program.  We 
made it clear that the only purpose of AOHell is to abuse the AOL 
service and that a number of issues their investigating (i.e., child porn, 
computer crimes, etc.) are attributable to AOHell users because they 
have unbridles access to AOL. In addition, the Feds were made aware 
that issues include: (1) Copyright/Intellectual Property Infringement; (2) 
Fraud on America Online; (3) Fraud on Banks and Credit Cards; (4) 
Unauthorized Access and (5) Other Actions (AOHell users have been 
linked to illegal activity which AOHell promotes (e.g., a bomb scare, 
death threats to political figures, software piracy, child pornography and 
harassment)).

The Feds stated that they were very interested in assisting us and that
they would be willing to investigate incidents of use and postings and
held track down the developer.  The DOJ attorney is computer literate 
and very familiar with ECPA.  He said that they would issue subpoenas 
to obtain information for their investigations.  The FBI agent, though 
not as computer savvy, appears eager to investigate and issue subpoenas.  
I can't assess the likelihood of his success.  Finally, the matter has also 
been referred to an Asst US Attorney for the eastern district of VA, Jack 
Hanly (who, I am told, does not have a computer).

The meeting resolved one problem for us.  The FBI will get the 
information from the coms/orgs/edus used to create web sites 
distributing AOHell as well as from coms/orgs/edus with which persons 
distributing AOHell have user ids.  If we got the information, unless it 
was a significant matter, we would not proceed on the civil side.  
Therefore, we should NOT proceed with our own subpoena efforts and 
use outside counsel on this, but rather we should (and I am starting to 
coordinate) handle the matter internally as follows:

(1) Webmaster and TOS will monitor newsgroups/web sites for AOHell
distribution and will pass on the information to the Legal Department.

(2) If its a web page distributing AOHell or a posting offering AOHell, 
we
will contact the com/org/edu and notify them that their services is being
used to distribute illegal hacking software.  Thus far, every com/org/edu
has terminated the web site.  Postmasters at com/org/edus will determine
whether the userid should be terminated pursuant to their applicable
"TOS".  This is the best way for us to take action.  When we get our
crimes specialist, he/she will undertake this effort.  In the meantime, I
have been calling and have enlisted Preston Green's assistance in 
tracking
things down and making certain calls.

(3) We will inform the com/org/edu that we are forwarding the info the 
FBI and they may be contacted soon.  Thus far, Agent McLean has been
contacting those com/org/edus I have identified.  Thus, the FBI can
investigate and do the leg work of tracking down Da Chronic.

Through this procedure we can take action ourselves to immediately (a) 
get the site/posting deleted and (b) get the perpetrator's service provider
involved and perhaps terminate his/her userid.  Further, with the FBI, 
DOJ and US Attys. offices involved, they can handle the investigation 
better than we can as far as compiling a file of all names associated with
distribution and tracking Da Chronic. Already I have been told that 
people are screaming (in some newsgroups) for AOHell 4 because web 
sites have been deleted (some I think through our efforts).

Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, etc.

		    A COMMENT ON C|NET
			 By Bone

	One Sunday morning (after a heavy night of drinking) I woke 
up around 8 AM and did what most people do.  I turned on the T.V.  
What I found was a show called C|NET.
	C|NET, if you don't already know, started out as sort of a 
newsletter about the computer world.  Not specific in any real way, just 
about the happenings and new products.  Anyway, it seems it has grown 
enough to get it's own T.V. show.
	So I'm watching C|NET and they start talking about AOL.  
Specifically they start talking about child pornography, and AOL's steps 
to regulate it.
	They stated that AOL has for a while been trying to regulate 
child pornography and has been working with the FBI.
	Now, anyone who knows AOL knows that is completely wrong.  
As talked about in CRN! #1 there are a ton of pornographic channels on 
AOL and a good portion do deal with children.
	I will admit something is going on because the local T.V. 
stations have had a few stories about child pornography busts in the area 
that dealt with computers.  But AOL enforcing it for a while? 
BUAHAHA.  Someone has to wake these C|NET reporters up.  That or 
teach them to see past the payoff checks and power AOL is using.
	They never mentioned anything about hacking, or AOHELL.  
You can bet this is because it is to embarrassing for AOL to have known 
to the general public/Joe Schmo user.
	C|NET later went on to other topics.  I had the distinct feeling 
that the reports were just that, reporters.  They really didn't have a good 
feel about computers of the Internet, and if they did, they have not been 
around like most of the readers of CRN! have.
	I really think someone from the underground needs to go to 
these people and smack them with reality.  Say "Hey!  You guys have 
NO idea what is really going on out there.  Start telling the truth!".
	Maybe then C|NET would also start talking about how CMU 
users had their first amendment rights basically stripped from them.  Oh 
I'm sorry.  Now that I'm in college I thought I could decide what is good 
and bad for me!  Nope, still need some 50+ yr old to tell me what to do.
Yep generation X, the sit back and take it generation (but that's another 
story).
	Back on topic.  C|NET seems to be some exec's idea of cashing 
in on those lovely keywords like "cyber space" or "surfing the net".  Nice 
production value, but the content just wasn't all there.

   	   QUICK REMARK ON THE MOVIE HACKERS
			By Bone

	I still have not had time to get out and see the thing.  
Supposedly it's a pretty decent movie, but off on some things.  All I 
know is everyone comes up to me going :
	"There is a guy who reminded me of you so much!"
	me : "Oh yea, who?"
	"There's a phreaker in it!"
	me : "Ok."
	"He was just like you!"
	me : "wow."(note sarcasm)
	"Yea, it was cool!"
	me : "Did they show any trashing or soc. eng'in?"
	"Umm..."
	and so on.....
	Anyway, I've never really been into those movies because I see 
it as someone just trying to make money.  That and a good portion of the 
stories leave out one little thing that represents a good portion of 
hackers.  A quest for knowledge.
	You see not every hacker is out to go hurt something or steal 
something.  A lot of them (including myself) are their in a quest for 
knowledge.  We were the little kids who tore apart old radios to see how 
they worked because we wanted to know.  We are not out to make 
money, we are out to learn new things.
	In this process a few laws may bend, some may even break.  We 
don't just blow this off, but it is a sacrifice that is made.  We build red 
box's to learn how the phone system works on tones.  We hack a system 
to learn how it is configured.  Or if it is an OS you have never seen, to 
learn it (System 75's (Difinity G's) are a good example).
	It is also a bit of a thrill.  When you con an operator into giving 
you an outside line.  You learn how the human mind works, how it can 
be tricked.  You feel a bit of power, the power of manipulation.
	It is these things that motivate most hackers.  It is not a need 
for destruction.  Granted there are some people out there who phreak 
just to save money, or hack just for destruction.  But there are always 
bad eggs.
	Don't forget the people who just want to learn how the system 
works and since they can't do it legally, they do it illegally.  It is a want 
for knowledge, not destruction.
	If you want to see a computer movie that's pretty realistic dig 
back a few years and watch WARGAMES.
